This is video of current version of gui tool with command line tools execution service

Tool is also working under Linux/Windows.

My suggestions:

1. It is needed to add "Back" button for all windows or add ability to make multiple calls to external functions during one call
of gui tool using another way.

2. It is not convient to enter file paths and commands manually. Maybe it is needed to have select for commands list, validate
count of parameters for each supported command and add ability to choose pathes using standard file/folder choose dialog.

There is only one problem with this thing. Command line tools have different names on different platforms. For example, copy tool
has name "copy" under Windows and "cp" under MacOSX. Sometimes I think that it will be good to have defines or standard variable to 
have ability to write native zlang platform-dependent code.
